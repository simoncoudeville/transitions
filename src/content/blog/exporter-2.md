One of the earliest and certainly most refined portable radios, the Exporter 2 designed by Dieter Rams in 1955 laid the groundwork for portable music devices as we know them today. Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer and visionary behind the iPod, was undoubtedly inspired by Rams in many of his products, praising Rams for his “bold, pure, perfectly-proportioned, coherent and effortless” designs. In fact, if the Exporter 2 were to be turned on its side, the visual similarities between the radio and a first generation iPod would be undeniable. Rams is also a fan of Ives and Apple, stating that “Without a doubt there are few companies the world that genuinely understand and practice the power of good design in their products and their business.”
